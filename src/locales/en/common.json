  "why": {
    "title": "Why CoStructure was created",
    "hook": "Did you know that most industrial buildings were designed by men – not because they had better ideas, but because women were simply not allowed to study for decades? And did you know that the many women who kept factories, workshops and telecommunication offices running are barely mentioned in the official narratives of industrial heritage?",
    "p1": "For over a hundred years, women were barely allowed to work as architects, engineers or technicians. Still, they achieved remarkable things: from inventions essential to everyday life to scientific discoveries like those of Marie Curie. Yet these stories are rarely told – and in urban space, they are almost invisible.",
    "p2": "CoStructure steps in here: the cubes bring forgotten perspectives back into everyday life. They make industrial heritage visible not only as a façade but as a network of people and stories – from workers, tinkerers, researchers, neighbours. And they show girls and young women that technology, design and urban space are not closed clubs but fields they can shape naturally.",
    "listIntro": "What the cubes make visible:",
    "list1": "that behind brick façades there are people – not just machines.",
    "list2": "that women have always played a role in industry, technology and urban design – even if they were rarely mentioned.",
    "list3": "that children, young people and adults today can connect their own visions of the future to these places.",
    "p3": "Today there is more visibility, more opportunity, more voices. Yet women remain underrepresented in many technical and design fields. The cubes invite us not only to name this gap but to close it together – through learning, exchange and rediscovering stories that have been pushed to the margins.",
    "p4": "CoStructure understands industrial heritage as a gender perspective in urban space: not didactic, but inviting. The cubes are places to pause, listen, marvel, participate – and maybe think: \"True… I never considered that before.\" That’s where change begins."

  "about": {
    "projectDescription": "<p>Berlin is shaped by industry. Many former industrial buildings can still be found outside typical industrial zones. Many of these structures appear impressive but also closed-off: monumental, dark, inaccessible or isolated. Historically, they were planned and built almost exclusively by men. Women appear in this history mostly as workers. Yet it is their labour, hours and strength that kept these places running.</p><br/><p>This is where the CoStructure cube comes in: an open, accessible place of encounter right beside historic industrial buildings. It invites visitors to rediscover industrial heritage from an expanded perspective. Alongside this, an interactive map presents locations, contexts and often overlooked stories. Together, they form a digital-physical project that makes industrial heritage more inclusive.</p>",
    "relevance": "<p>Industrial heritage is a central part of Berlin’s history – but one told mostly from a male perspective. Women, queer people and other marginalised groups are barely represented. Even today, many industrial areas feel functional, rough and unsafe at night – rarely like places that serve everyone equally.</p><p>Why is this relevant? Spaces are never neutral. They signal belonging or exclusion. Marginalised groups remain largely invisible in industrial history. Industrial sites are often perceived as unsafe. And when historic buildings are repurposed, gender perspectives are rarely considered. The cube and the map address these gaps and reopen these spaces.</p>",
    "currentStatus": "<p>The digital map already highlights selected industrial heritage sites and connects them to historical contexts. Filters, time layers and story elements make the content accessible and interactive.</p><p>The cube concept is being developed in parallel: a light, modular structure that prioritises openness, visibility and inclusion. Next steps include material specification, selecting a pilot location and integrating personal stories.</p>",
    "benefits": "<p><strong>For urban space:</strong></p><p> • Activation of neglected or unsafe places<br/> • Improved quality of stay and visibility<br/> • Low-threshold meeting point<br/> • New attention for historic buildings</p><p><strong>For society:</strong></p><p> • Visibility of women’s labour and history<br/> • Awareness of gender-sensitive urban planning<br/> • Strengthening social participation<br/> • Public space for everyone</p><p><strong>For visitors:</strong></p><p> • Easy access to knowledge<br/> • Safe, open place to stay<br/> • Space for exhibitions, workshops and encounters<br/> • A sign that the city belongs to everyone</p>",
    "implementation": "<p>Implementation consists of two interconnected parts:</p><p><strong>1. The cube:</strong><br/> • modular, light and adaptable<br/> • open structure with clear sightlines and lighting<br/> • materials referencing industrial heritage<br/> • barrier-free and safe<br/> • space for information, exhibitions and encounter</p><p><strong>2. The digital map:</strong><br/> • shows industrial heritage sites<br/> • connects historical and gender-related content<br/> • offers filters by time, use and theme<br/> • continuously expandable<br/> • links digital and physical urban experiences</p>",
    "knowledgeTransfer": "<p>The cube is an open place for learning and encounter. It conveys knowledge in a low-threshold, accessible and everyday way – not as a museum.</p><p>Content includes:<br/>- history of Berlin’s industrial heritage<br/>- roles of women and marginalised groups<br/>- basics of gender-sensitive urban planning<br/>- visible and invisible labour<br/>- perceptions of safety and space<br/>- neighbourhood perspectives</p>",
    "stories": "<p>Stories are at the heart of this project. They reveal how many perspectives have been missing in industrial heritage.</p><p>They include:<br/>- women who kept factories running during wartime<br/>- women whose labour was never documented<br/>- everyday experiences of women around industrial sites<br/>- voices from the neighbourhood<br/>- today’s view of industrial areas as fascinating or unsafe<br/>- examples of successful and failed reuse</p><p>These stories reveal what industrial heritage often hides: that these places were full of life – and can be again.</p>"
